Siyu Yi (易思宇) is currently a postdoc researcher in the School of Mathematics, Sichuan University (SCU), under the supervision of Prof. [Huazhen Lin](https://www.huazhenlin.com/). Before joining SCU, I received my Ph.D. degree in the School of Statistics and Data Science from Nankai University in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Yongdao Zhou](https://my.nankai.edu.cn/stat/zyd/list.htm). My current research interests lie primarily in the area of graph machine learning, bigdata subsampling, and AI4Science.
